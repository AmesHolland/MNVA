            "content": "The World Resources Institute has published a commentary stating that 2025 has been dubbed a \"Super Year\" for ocean governance, with significant progress made on multiple major treaties, conferences and initiatives: ① A historic breakthrough has been achieved in high seas protection with the official entry into force of the BBNJ Agreement, yet it is still necessary to establish decision-making bodies, scientific advisory mechanisms and financial support systems to strengthen its implementation; ② The first step has been taken in combating overfishing as the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement entered into force in September, prohibiting subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and overfishing, while the second-phase negotiations covering content such as fuel subsidies are still ongoing; ③ Plastic pollution governance has stalled, as global plastic treaty negotiations failed to reach an agreement due to differences over \"source reduction\" and \"end-of-pipe treatment\", and consultations will continue in 2026; ④ Rules for deep-sea mining remain undecided, with the International Seabed Authority failing to adopt mining regulations and countries divided in their positions. The United States, a non-party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is pushing for the acceleration of mining permits, exacerbating the complexity of governance; ⑤ Global ocean cooperation has expanded, with 11 new countries joining the \"100% Sustainable Ocean Management\" initiative, and the European Union adopting the European Ocean Treaty with plans to legislate for its implementation by 2027; ⑥ Ocean climate action has been strengthened. During the Our Ocean Conference, the UN Ocean Conference and the UN Climate Change Conference, ocean issues have been significantly integrated into the climate agenda. 92% of coastal countries have included ocean measures in their newly submitted nationally determined contributions, and 6 new countries have joined the Blue NDC Challenge. Overall, 2025 has seen remarkable achievements in institutional building and political consensus, but there is a huge funding gap. In 2026, commitments need to be translated into concrete actions to truly realize a sustainable ocean future.",

            "content": "Anote Tong, former President of Kiribati, has stated publicly that although the short-term benefits of deep-sea mining are highly attractive to Pacific island countries, meaning increased fiscal revenue and enhanced economic resilience, against the backdrop of the growing impacts of climate change, leaders of Pacific island countries should pay more attention to the potential negative environmental impacts of such activities. For example, deep-sea mining may affect the migration and spawning grounds of tuna. Leaders of Pacific island countries should request institutions such as the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme to conduct scientific and objective assessments on this as soon as possible, and should consider deep-sea mining cautiously before the completion of such assessments.",

            "content": "Reported by Mongabay on December 8, Norway has closed its waters to deep-sea mining until at least 2029, thus halting an industry that was on the verge of launch despite its environmental risks. On December 3, five political parties supporting the new Norwegian government debated the fiscal budget and unanimously agreed that the government would not launch the first round of bidding for deep-sea mineral mining permits originally scheduled for 2026. The parties also decided to cut the government's public funding budget for seabed mapping related to deep-sea mining. Two days later, on December 5, the parliament officially voted to suspend deep-sea mining activities, overturning the previous decision to advance the industry. Countries such as the United States and Japan appear to be pushing forward with their deep-sea mining plans.",

            "content": "On December 5, researchers from the Natural History Museum in London, the National Oceanography Centre in the UK and the University of Gothenburg published a landmark paper entitled \"Impacts of an industrial deep-sea mining trial on macrofaunal biodiversity\" in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. The paper presents the most comprehensive biodiversity impact assessment to date on the deep-sea mining trial conducted by The Metals Company (TMC) in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Pacific Ocean. Funded by The Metals Company (TMC), the five-year study involved 160 days of offshore operations. Researchers compared the biodiversity levels in the mining area (located on the deep-sea floor at a depth of 4,000 meters) two years before and two months after the mining trial, and investigated an 80-kilometer-long mining operation area. The background of the study is that in 2022, Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), a subsidiary of The Metals Company (TMC), conducted a large-scale test of commercial deep-sea mining equipment in the abyssal plain of the eastern Pacific Ocean at a depth of 4,280 meters, collecting more than 3,000 tonnes of polymetallic nodules. Key findings of the study include: ● A sharp drop in benthic animal populations in the mining vehicle operation area: marine life numbers decreased by 37% and species richness declined by 32%; ● Outside the mining vehicle operation area, despite the impact of sediment plumes generated by mining, there was no reduction in benthic animal populations; ● 4,350 benthic organisms with a body size of 0.3 mm to 2 cm were found, belonging to a total of 788 species, 90% of which are new species, including worms, sea spiders, snails and clams.",

            "title": "Norway and the Cook Islands Successively Halt Deep-Sea Mining",
            "content": "Norway and the Cook Islands, major participants in deep-sea mining, have successively announced the suspension or postponement of relevant deep-sea mining processes. Situation in Norway: On December 3, the Norwegian government announced that the ruling party and the opposition had reached an agreement to suspend deep-sea mining activities and would not issue deep-sea mining permits until 2029, meaning that the country's deep-sea mining may not start until at least 2030. Earlier last year, Norway became the world's first country to allow commercial deep-sea mining and also the first to permit seabed mineral mining on its continental shelf (the International Seabed Authority regulates international seabed mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, and mining on a country's own continental shelf is not subject to the authority's restrictions). Norway originally planned to start granting Arctic seabed mining licences to enterprises in 2025, and intended to open up 280,000 square kilometres of Arctic waters for mining, later delineating 386 offshore blocks, accounting for about 38% of the approved exploration area. In 2024, at least two Norwegian mining companies applied for deep-sea mining permits, one of which went bankrupt that year. At the end of 2024, the Socialist Left Party, a small left-wing environmental organisation in Norway, reached an agreement with the ruling party to postpone the deep-sea mining plan in exchange for its support for the national budget, leading Norway to suspend the Arctic territorial sea seabed mining plan. This time, the new ruling Labour Party and the opposition Socialist Left Party have reached an agreement to not launch the first round of deep-sea mining bidding within four years; the Norwegian government also stated that it will no longer use public funds for mineral resource exploration. The Norwegian government stressed that this move does not represent a reversal of the country's long-term policy in support of deep-sea mining, and will use the suspension period to conduct further research and finalise relevant regulations before issuing mining permits in the future. Environmental organisations commented that this is a major shift in the Norwegian government's stance on deep-sea mining. A 2023 official Norwegian assessment report showed that the country's Arctic seabed contains 38 million tonnes of copper, 45 million tonnes of zinc and \"large quantities\" of rare earth elements. Anette Broch Mathisen Tvedt, head of Norwegian start-up Adepth Minerals, said the decision would jeopardise the strategically important emerging deep-sea mining industry. Situation in the Cook Islands: In November, the Cook Islands, a Pacific island country, announced a five-year extension of deep-sea mining applications in its waters, meaning that deep-sea mining in the region will be delayed until at least 2032. In 2022, the Cook Islands issued exploration licences to three mining companies, allowing them to conduct seabed mineral exploration for five years to determine mining feasibility, with the licences valid until February 2027. At present, the three approved mining companies have not completed their approved exploration work plans. Ataiera, Seabed Mining Commissioner of the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), said that if enterprises wish to continue exploration, they need to apply for a five-year extension of their exploration licences. Mineral resources in the Arctic: The Arctic region contains a variety of strategic minerals, with distributions varying by region. Proven mining areas in Greenland contain rare earth elements required for the manufacture of magnets and electronic products; in addition to copper and iron ores, the northern Swedish mining belt produces ores containing rare earth elements. Other parts of the Arctic have deposits of germanium, gallium, antimony, titanium, tungsten and other minerals, which are mainly hosted in specific hard rock formations and are not regional deposits; in addition, there are scattered deposits of gold, silver, copper, zinc, platinum, palladium and other minerals.",

            "title": "Norwegian Parliament Decides to Impose a Comprehensive Suspension on Deep-Sea Mining Plans Until Autumn 2029",
            "content": "The Norwegian Parliament has decided to impose a comprehensive suspension on all deep-sea mining plans in Arctic waters until the end of the current parliamentary term, i.e., before autumn 2029. During this period, the government will no longer issue any exploration or mining permits, and will simultaneously cut government funding for deep-sea mineral resource mapping, which is a key support for the development of the deep-sea mining industry. Previously, the Norwegian government delineated 386 offshore blocks available for exploration, accounting for 38% of the 280,000 square kilometre area approved by the parliament earlier this year. In 2024, at least two enterprises submitted licence applications. The Norwegian government hoped to increase Europe's supply of rare earths and battery metals such as copper, nickel and manganese through deep-sea mining in the Arctic region, which are key raw materials for clean energy technologies and the defence industry. The suspension decision brings Norway's stance closer to the precautionary principle of its Nordic partners and the OSPAR Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic. Although the suspension is of a temporary political nature and has not yet formed a formal legal \"precautionary pause\" or \"mining ban\", it is regarded as an important step to avoid potential ecological disasters. The chairman of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature called it a \"historic victory for the deep sea\". The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition commented that Norway, once an active supporter of deep-sea mining, has now shifted its stance in line with mainstream scientific recommendations, and called on the world to follow Norway's example and promote a suspension of deep-sea mining to prevent irreversible damage to the deep-sea ecosystem. Ocean Crisis said Norway has \"stepped back from the brink\" and called for upgrading the temporary compromise into a long-term mining ban based on science and international law.",

            "content": "On November 24, UBS Investment Bank released an assessment report stating that deep-sea mining will accelerate over the next decade, with its costs expected to match those of onshore mining by 2033. The core findings of the report include: ① The estimated value of mineral resources in the deep sea (water depth over 200 meters, accounting for 90% of the total ocean area) reaches 177 trillion US dollars, and could hit 287 trillion US dollars in an optimistic scenario; ② Technological advancements will drive down the unit cost of deep-sea metal ore mining, which is expected to be on par with onshore mining costs by 2033; ③ Capital expenditure demand is robust, with capital spending on deep-sea metal ore mining equipment set to reach 150 billion US dollars over the next decade and surge to 1.5 trillion US dollars from 2036 to 2050 (compared with approximately 2.5 trillion US dollars in capital expenditure for offshore oil and gas exploration and development over the same period). The core drivers behind the growing attention on deep-sea mining are as follows: the green energy transition and emerging high-tech industries have spurred increased demand for critical metals such as copper, cobalt, nickel and rare earths. Meanwhile, onshore reserves are approaching their peak, geopolitics has intensified supply pressures, and coupled with the abundant deep-sea mineral resources with some higher grades, all these factors are jointly driving the accelerated development of this sector. The report recommends focusing on two key areas: in the short term, focus on the supply chain of Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units (with a market size of 300 billion US dollars over the next decade) and deepwater drilling platforms; in the long term, be bullish on deep-sea mining equipment (the total market size is expected to reach 17 trillion US dollars from 2026 to 2050). Existing enterprises in the FPSO supply chain and manufacturers of equipment such as underwater robots are expected to benefit. Environmental and biodiversity protection, the slow regulatory process of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and cost and technical barriers are the main reasons why the market has low expectations for the commercialization of deep-sea mining in the next 5 to 10 years. However, industry dynamics show that The Metals Company (TMC) plans to achieve commercialization in the fourth quarter of 2027, and the United States' accelerated regulation of deep-sea mining is also challenging the ISA's approval process. Combined with the optimistic forecasts of UBS's cost analysis model, these factors bring important variables to the development of the deep-sea mining sector.",

As a strategic mineral, cobalt has a seabed reserve of 73 billion tonnes (more than 600 times the known onshore reserves). China was authorized by the UN International Seabed Authority (ISA) in 2013 to legally explore a 3,000 square kilometre cobalt-rich crust mining area in the Western Pacific, and currently dominates the global cobalt mining and refining sector. In contrast, the US Department of Defense's cobalt reserve program launched earlier this year was cancelled in October due to technical bottlenecks and transportation difficulties. The global competition for deep-sea resources is becoming increasingly fierce. US President Trump signed an executive order in April allowing US private companies to carry out deep-sea mining without the approval of UN authorities. However, scientists from many countries have warned that unregulated and premature deep-sea mining may damage the fragile marine ecosystem and trigger irreversible ecological disasters.",

DSRM is the parent company of Deep Sea Vision (DSV), an operator of automated underwater equipment. The application comes as it hosts the 2025 Underwater Minerals Conference in Honolulu from November 9 to 14. Against the backdrop, US President Trump signed an executive order in April this year to advance the deep-sea mining industry, and NOAA has recently promised to speed up the relevant approval process to avoid unwarranted delays in reviews. Tony Romeo, CEO of DSRM and a former US Air Force intelligence officer, stated that relying on the company's own advantages in deepwater equipment and operations, it hopes to become an independent US supplier of critical minerals through cooperation, helping to stabilize the national mineral supply chain.

The vessel had been surveying seabed mineral deposits in the Cook Islands' waters for the previous three weeks, with its exploration activities carried out in cooperation with the Cook Islands government and funded by the Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The activists criticized the move as an act by powerful countries such as the United States to seize control of deep-sea minerals in the Pacific Ocean under the guise of scientific exploration and to demonstrate military strength. They expressed concerns that this would accelerate deep-sea mining in the Cook Islands and the entire Pacific region, threatening the fragile marine ecosystem as well as the sovereignty, culture and well-being of indigenous peoples.
